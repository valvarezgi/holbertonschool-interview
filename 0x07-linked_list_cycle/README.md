# 0x07. Linked list cycle

## Description

What you should learn from this project:

* Practice for future interviews

---

### [0. Linked list cycle](./0-check_cycle.c)

**Technical interview preparation:**

* You are not allowed to google anything.
* Whiteboard first.
* This task and all future technical interview prep tasks will include checks for the efficiency of your solution, i.e. is your solutionâ€™s runtime fast enough, does your solution require extra memory usage / mallocs, etc.

Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.

* Prototype: int check_cycle(listint_t *list);
* Return: 0 if there is no cycle, 1 if there is a cycle

***Requirements:***

* Only these functions are allowed: *write*, *printf*, *putchar*, *puts*, *malloc*, *free*
