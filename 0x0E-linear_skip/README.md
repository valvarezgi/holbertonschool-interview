## Description

What you should learn from this project:

### [0. Linear search in a skip list](./0-linear_skip.c)

* Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list.
A common way to optimize the time complexity of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it.
A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list.
