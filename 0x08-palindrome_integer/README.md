### [0. Palindrome unsigned integer](./0-is_palindrome.c)

* Write a function that checks whether or not a given unsigned integer is a palindrome.
  * Prototype: int is_palindrome(unsigned long n);
  * Where n is the number to be checked
  * Your function must return 1 if n is a palindrome, and 0 otherwise
